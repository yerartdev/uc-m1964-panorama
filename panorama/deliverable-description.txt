Practise: Building a weather generator
Using R or Python (or both). Indicative examples provided in R

Introduction

Weather generators are computational models which generate (daily) synthetic series of random values simulating the distribution of a particular meteorological variable. Precipitation is the most popular example due to its mixed character: discrete (ocurrence: dry or wet) and continuous (rain amount for wet days). The discrete part is typically characterized by the frequency of wet/dry days (say, e.g. 0.53/0.47 in Santander), whereas the continuous is typically characterized by an exponential distribution defined by a rate parameter (you don't need to understand statistics for this practise! it is only about programming).

In this practice we will use the main control structures (conditionals and loops) and apply them to build a simple weather generator and create artificial precipitation amount series. To this aim we will use some functions which simulate (pseudo)random numbers from different families of distributions (uniform and exponential), which is a key task for several computational statistics problems (you will learn a lot more about this in the stastistics course).
